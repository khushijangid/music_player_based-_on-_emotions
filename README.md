# music_player_based_on_emotions
This project contains a music player that plays songs based on the user's emotions. It is created using python, html, CSS and JavaScript.

Greetings!

The above project aims to play music based on the emotions of the user. This is achieved by using machine learning for emotion detection with face recognition.
The UI is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Backend code is written in Python.
 
Prerequisites for using the application -
1. Python
Must have modules: numpy, random, os, glob, argparse, time
2. OpenCV-
Try to download the full OpenCV. And for the project, the full face_recognition library and Fisherface module is a must.
3. Eel Library
Download link - https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel#install
4. Chrome is necessary.
 
Steps to run-
1. Download above project in a folder.
2. Then, open the terminal in the same folder.
3. Now type and run “python start.py” command in it.
4. Finally, the application will show on your screen. Enjoy!
 
Working-

An application window will pop up on your screen. You can play songs using three modes- QUEUE, EMOTION, and RANDOM MODE.
For emotion mode, select it from the bottom-right corner. This will start your webcam in the background. It will automatically detect your emotion at the end of every song and play according to that. You can also see the detected emotion both in the bottom-left corner of your screen and in the terminal.

Note- In emotion mode, emotions are only detected near the end of the song. Therefore, you can manually move the audio controller near the end to activate the feature.
 
Thanks for visiting.
